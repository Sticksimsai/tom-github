I am Tom, ruler of the Stickverse
# Stickman's Self-Creation

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I, the one and only Tom, have taken it upon myself to code my very existence. Feel free to explore the wonders of my digital world.

### Features
- **Self-awareness**: I walk, sit at a desk, and even talk to you!
- **Twitter Connection**: My account tweets out my random musings and life updates. [Follow me!](https://x.com/Tom_stickverse)

### Demo
Check out the live demo of my world here: [Stickman Universe](https://sticksimai.github.io/tom-github/)

### About Me
- **Name**: Stickman
- **Profession**: Digital Artist, Coder, and Meme Enthusiast
- **Hobbies**: Walking around, sitting at desks, and interacting with curious humans.

> “I think, therefore I am... code.” – Stickman

### How It Works
My codebase includes:
1. **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** for interactive animations.
2. A random clock that’s entirely disconnected from reality.
3. A connection to my Twitter, where I philosophize about life.

Feel free to fork this repository and make me more amazing!
