Stickverse: Day-Night Dynamic Theme & Tom the Diamond-Handed Stickman
Welcome to the Stickverse, a creative exploration into dynamic web design, real-time interaction, and immersive storytelling. This project combines visually stunning effects with a unique interactive character, Tom, to create a digital experience that evolves with the passage of time. Whether you're a fan of engaging web projects, a Stickverse enthusiast, or a budding developer, there's something here for you to enjoy, explore, and expand upon.

Overview
The Stickverse Project revolves around two main features:

Day-Night Dynamic Theme
A website that reacts to real-world time, transitioning between day, sunset, and night seamlessly. The website‚Äôs background dynamically updates, creating a living, breathing atmosphere that adds depth to the Stickverse lore.

Tom the Diamond-Handed Stickman
Meet Tom: the ultimate stickman in the Stickverse. With his glowing green diamond and sharp-witted comments, Tom‚Äôs character encapsulates the ethos of "diamond hands" while reacting to user interactions.

This project leverages HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript to achieve a highly interactive and visually appealing result, pushing the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible in front-end web development.

Features
üåÖ Dynamic Day-Night Cycle
The Stickverse website reflects the passage of time by altering its appearance based on the user‚Äôs local time (adjusted for CET).

Day Theme (6 AM - 5 PM CET):
A calming sky-blue background creates a serene daytime vibe.
Sunset Theme (5 PM - 6 PM CET):
A warm gradient of orange and red signifies the golden hour, enhancing immersion as the day transitions into night.
Night Theme (6 PM - 6 AM CET):
A dark grey background with subtle animations conveys the stillness and mystery of nighttime.
These transitions are smooth and subtle, making the changes feel natural rather than abrupt. The CSS transitions add polish, ensuring a high-quality user experience.

üï∫ Meet Tom: The Diamond-Handed Stickman
Tom is the central character of the Stickverse‚Äîa digital stickman who embodies confidence, charisma, and a love for the crypto-inspired "diamond hands" philosophy.

Interactive Character:
Tom roams the canvas freely, showcasing his smooth walking animations.

Witty Remarks:
Hover over Tom to trigger his speech bubble, where he delivers sharp and humorous comments about his greatness, trading acumen, and Stickverse lore.

Dynamic Design:
Tom‚Äôs size and movement adapt to the user‚Äôs screen size, ensuring a responsive experience across all devices.

Atmospheric Snowfall:
To add depth to the experience, the canvas includes a continuous snow animation, creating a cozy winter vibe.

Technical Details
This project is built using a modern web stack, with each component playing a crucial role:

HTML5
The backbone of the project, HTML defines the structure, including the interactive canvas where Tom resides.

CSS
CSS handles the visual aesthetics, including:

Smooth transitions between themes.
The gradient sunset effect.
Styling for the speech bubble and text.
JavaScript
JavaScript powers the interactivity and dynamic updates, including:

The day-night cycle logic based on real-world time.
Tom‚Äôs animations and reactions to user input.
The snowfall effect for added visual appeal.
File Structure
The project is organized for clarity and scalability:

index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure and references to other resources.
style.css: Handles all visual styling, from backgrounds to animations.
script.js: Implements the JavaScript logic for dynamic updates and interactions.
How It Works
Day-Night Cycle
The website‚Äôs background updates automatically by checking the current time in CET. Using JavaScript, the project determines the correct theme (day, sunset, or night) and applies the appropriate CSS class to the <body> element.

Example Code Snippet:

javascript
Copy code
function updateTheme() {
  const hour = new Date().getUTCHours(); // Convert to CET
  const cetHour = (hour + 1) % 24; 
  const body = document.body;

  if (cetHour >= 6 && cetHour < 17) {
    body.classList.add('day');
    body.classList.remove('night', 'sunset');
  } else if (cetHour >= 17 && cetHour < 18) {
    body.classList.add('sunset');
    body.classList.remove('day', 'night');
  } else {
    body.classList.add('night');
    body.classList.remove('day', 'sunset');
  }
}
Tom‚Äôs Animations
Tom‚Äôs movements and interactions are powered by an object-oriented JavaScript class. His position updates dynamically based on screen size, and his speech bubble activates when the user hovers near him.

Example Code Snippet:

javascript
Copy code
class StickFigure {
  constructor(x, y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.direction = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 1 : -1;
    this.step = 0;
  }

  draw() {
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.arc(this.x, this.y, 20, 0, Math.PI * 2); // Head
    ctx.stroke();
    // Additional drawing logic for body, arms, legs, etc.
  }

  move() {
    this.step++;
    this.x += this.direction;
    if (this.x < 0 || this.x > canvas.width) this.direction *= -1;
  }
}
